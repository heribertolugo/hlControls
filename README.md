# hlControls
Project for free user controls in .NET

Created in 2014, and originally submitted to [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/768632/How-to-fake-freeze-last-row-in-datagridview) as a footer to sum rows in WinForms DataGridView.
This repository is missing the solution file (which can be found in CodeProject) and only contains source files.
